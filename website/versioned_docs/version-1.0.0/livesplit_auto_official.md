## Specifications:

**For a number of reasons explained below, please install the [Peacock Autosplitter](https://www.speedrun.com/hitman_3/guide/vamms) if you have the option to do so. It is more accurate, although it does require installing [Peacock](https://thepeacockproject.org/wiki/intel/) as well.**

- Does not split between levels automatically although a running total of the in game time is maintained. The use of the term "autosplitter" below is just due to convenience.

- Keep a running total of the in-game time from each level.

- Timer will be paused when in loading screens, inventory, planning screen in between levels, and during intro/ exit cutscenes.

- Will not work correctly from the Outside Start of Romania (Untouchable).

- Works on official servers. Technically it works on Peacock, but it may be buggier, plus Peacock has its own autosplitter.

- This autosplitter is not 100% accurate, this tool is just to get a decent estimate of your final in game time. Runs will be retimed by moderators as necessary.

### Main Game Mode vs Freelancer

- The Freelancer splitter is RTA loadless, not in-game-time. The Freelancer splitter does not count time spent in Inventory or Pause screen. It _can_ be used in the main game mode but it is not advised.
- The Main Game Mode splitter tracks in-game time, meaning the timer does not run during Inventory or Pause Screen.
- The Freelancer splitter is on both Steam and Epic while the Main Game Mode splitter is Epic only at the moment.
  - That is simply due to the devs for each splitter only owning the game on one platform; in theory, either splitter can be configured to work on both platforms, provided people are available to keep updating the memory addresses on both platforms after each game patch.
  - See [Contribution Guidelines](livesplit_auto_official#contribution-instructions)

## Autosplitter Files Download

Download Livesplit [here](https://livesplit.org/downloads/)

### Main Game Mode

- **Download the hitman3.asl code for main game mode here:** https://github.com/solderq35/hitman-tech-tips/blob/main/asl/main-game-mode/hitman3_igt_epic.asl
  - NOTE: The file above only works on Epic Games version although it can also be configured for Steam with right memory addresses
  - Remember, this tracks in-game time, and the timer does not run during Inventory or Pause Screen (unlike the Freelancer splitter below)

## Installation

**Steps below will work for both Main Game Mode and Freelancer autosplitter. **

Unzip the folder of the Livesplit Download, and then click on the Livesplit Application to start. Unzip the hitman3.asl file from its folder as well.

Right click on main Livesplit application window, go to "Edit Splits". Here you can enter information about the game name, category, and splits for each map to your liking. Be sure to select the "Game Time" option. Enter your estimated in game time splits for each map in "segment time" column.

Click "okay", then right click the main Livesplit application window and click on "save splits as" to save the splits for later use.

Right click on main Livesplit application window, and go to "Edit Layout". Click on the "+" symbol, then go to "Control", then "Scriptable Autosplitter". Double click on "Scriptable Autosplitter", then "browse", and select the hitman3.asl file you downloaded earlier.

![Layout](https://i.ibb.co/Mn4qC8w/editlayout.png)

Click "okay", then right click the main Livesplit application window and click on "save layout as" to save the splits for later use.

Right click on main Livesplit application window, and go to "Compare Against", then "Game Time".

Right click on main Livesplit application window, and go to "Settings", and adjust hotkeys as needed. "Numpad 1" (have Num Lock on) is the default for starting and splitting.

## Usage Instructions

Start game. Press Numpad 1 (default binding). The livesplit timer should turn green, but still be set as 0.

Start the first level; the timer should start after first level's initial cutscene is ended.

You can press numpad 1 again to move the split to the next level (Sapienza). (this is what is meant by, the script does not actually autosplit). If you don't press numpad 1 again, the in game time will be kept track of accurately as you move to the next level, but it will stay on Paris or whatever your first level is.

Press numpad 3 (default value) to reset timer. Remember to press numpad 1 again and wait for timer to turn green to start again if you want to go again.

Final disclaimer: Timer may not be 100% accurate, use rating screen + on screen in game timer to retime as necessary later

## Contribution Instructions
